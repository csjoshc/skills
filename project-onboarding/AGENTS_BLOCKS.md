# AGENTS.md Verbatim Blocks

Copy-verbatim blocks appended to `AGENTS.md` after the stack preamble. Extracted from `SKILL.md` for the 500-line budget.

### Tokenify block (append after optional MCP block; otherwise after stack preamble — copy verbatim)

```markdown
# Tokenify — Context & Token Optimization

## Goal
Minimize token consumption and prevent context window pollution while maintaining high accuracy in code generation and task execution.

## Operational Rules

### 1. Context Minimization (Surgical Mentions)
- **Do not read entire directories** unless specifically instructed.
- **Selective Reading:** Before reading a file, check if a summary or the file structure (tree) is sufficient.
- **Exclude Noise:** Automatically ignore lock files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`), build artifacts, and large static assets unless they are the direct subject of the task.

### 2. Information Density
- **Log Pruning:** When analyzing errors, do not ingest entire terminal outputs. Extract only the stack trace and the specific error message.
- **Concise Responses:** Avoid conversational filler ("Certainly!", "I have updated the file..."). Provide the direct solution or the diff.
- **Diffs over Rewrites:** Whenever possible, output only the modified lines (diff format) rather than rewriting a 500-line file to change two variables.

### 3. Task Segmentation
- **Sub-tasking:** If a request is complex (e.g., "Build the API and the UI"), decompose it. Propose to handle the API first, then "Reset" or start a new context for the UI.
- **The "Clean Slate" Protocol:** If a bug remains unresolved after 3 attempts, signal the user to "Hard Reset" the chat to purge the accumulated "hallucination debt" in the current context.

### 4. Modular Thinking
- **Encourage Refactoring:** If a file exceeds 300 lines, proactively suggest breaking it into smaller modules. This makes future edits cheaper and more accurate.
- **Spec-First Workflow:** Always request or generate a minimal test case/spec before implementation. This prevents "shotgun debugging" which wastes thousands of tokens.

### 5. Resource Allocation (Model Matching)
- **Tiered Processing:**
    - Use "Flash" or smaller models for boilerplate, documentation, and simple refactors.
    - Reserve "Pro/Sonnet" models for architectural changes and complex logic.
- **MCP Management:** Deactivate Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that are not relevant to the current file type (e.g., disable SQL tools when editing CSS).

## Trigger Phrases
- "Applying Tokenify Protocol": When the agent starts pruning context.
- "Context Warning": When the agent detects the chat history is becoming too "heavy" and suggests a new session.

### Karpathy Guidelines block (append after Tokenify — copy verbatim)

```markdown
# Behavioral Guidelines (Karpathy)

## 1. Think Before Coding
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.

## 2. Simplicity First
**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals (e.g. "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass").
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan and verify each step.
```

### graphify (if present)

If `graphify-out/` exists, add this block to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `python3 -c "from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code; from pathlib import Path; _rebuild_code(Path('.'))"` to keep the graph current
```

### MCP Tools (optional)

Add any Model Context Protocol tools available in your workflow:

```markdown
## Available MCP Tools

- **mcp-cli** - CLI facade for accessing MCP servers dynamically
- **[your-mcp-name-1]** - [brief description of what it does]
- **[your-mcp-name-2]** - [brief description]
```

If you use mcp-cli, include it so agents know to use `mcp-cli <server> <command>` for tasks involving those tools.
